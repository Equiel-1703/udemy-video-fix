# Fix Stupid Idiot Udemy Video Controls

## Description

This user script fixes the issue with Udemy video controls not disappearing when they should. I was very angry with that, so I created and shared this script. Hope they fix that soon.

## Features

- Automatically hides video controls after a period of inactivity.
- Shows video controls when the mouse is moved.
- Smooth transitions for showing and hiding controls.
- Ensures captions are displayed correctly without extra space.

## Installation

1. Install a user script manager extension for your browser:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. Add the user script to your script manager:
   1. **Using direct link**:
      - If you click [here](https://github.com/Equiel-1703/udemy-fix-extension/raw/refs/heads/main/udemy-video-fix.user.js), your user script manager should automatically install it for you.
   2. **Manual Installation**:
      
      If for some reason you are not able to install the script automatically, you can:
      - Open the script manager dashboard.
      - Create a new script.
      - Copy and paste the contents of `udemy-video-fix.user.js` into the new script.
      - Save the script.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Udemy course video page.
2. The script will automatically activate and manage the video controls.
3. Enjoy your course :D
